# Plotly Deployment Practice

## Overview 
A hypothetical situation was provided to get practice in the use of Plotly for charts, GitHub’s Pages facility, and JavaScript (ECMAScript).  The situation involved a hypothetical company, “Improbable Beef” who hoped to manufacture a synthetic meat substitute based on one or more bacterial strains commonly found in human navels. The data used in the analysis was “provided” by Improbable Beef in a file with a JSON format. The data included metadata specific to each participant, multiple samples taken for each participant, and the number of bacteria overall along with a listing of the bacterial strains found in each sample.
## Analysis
A dashboard was created that allowed users to explore three different aspects of the data specific to each “participant” in the study. The user selects a participant from a drop-down menu, and the participant’s metadata is displayed in a box while three charts are built: first, a bar chart indicating the most prevalent bacteria found in the sample (up to the top ten), second, the washing frequency of the participant displayed in a gauge format, and third, a bubble chart to visualize both the amount of bacteria (by range an bubble size) and a listing of bacteria found (displayed by hovering over specific bubbles).
